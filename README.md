## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The goals of my application were to create an inventory management database that allows users to add, read, update, and delete items. The read method displays a list of a users items to them in a recyclerview. The create method allows users to add new items to their inventory with the option for regular notifications and SMS notifications when a new item is added. The update method allows users to click on an item and bring up a dialog menu allowing them to edit the name, date, and/or quantity of an item. Lastly, the delete method allows users to remove an item from their inventory completely, with an option in the settings to completely clear the data without having to navigate to the app settings to do so (this includes preferences such as SMS notifications resetting to default, which is off). 

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

Some of the screens that were required for this application to perform properly are a Login screen, Sign-Up screen, a Forgot Password screen, an Inventory List screen, A data edit dialog screen, and a Settings screen. My UI designs for my screens kept potential users of the app in mind by providing easy to read font types, colors that are cool and inviting, and a very easy to navigate layout for each screen, prompting users to guide them through the sign up process, login process and any other features included. 

## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

One of the biggest approaches I took to coding the logic behind my app was modular developing. By developing piece by piece I was able to breakdown development per each screen, and even further so breaking it down by each functionality of the app. Another approach I used was constant testing of my app. Each time I added code, I would test it, as well as test every other bit of my code to ensure functionality was running smoothly throughout the entire application. These techniques will be used consistently throughout my coursework and career as a computer scientist/software engineer. 

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

I tested constantly and consistently as mentioned previously, each time a new function was added to my code. This process helps ensure developers that their code is working together and everything is running smoothly as it should be. 

## Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

While most of my planning process and designing process came fairly easily to me, there was no shortage of challenges in both the logical side and UI side of my application. One challenge I had to overcome was the implementation of notification switches (regular and SMS notifications) being added to my settings page and having them properly display a users' preferences. I overcame this by constant testing and tweaking of the code I had implemented. I eventually did a bit of research and found that SMS permission can only be changed through the app settings so instead of trying to change it straight from the app, I made so the user navigates to the app settings to allow them to change their permissions and reflected their choice through the use of the notification switches.

## In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I felt very anxious coming into the logical side of my application and making everything work together as this is one of my first projects I started from scratch. However, I found as I went on developing it came naturally to me and I was able to implement each of the features I wanted to add without more than simple bug fixes here and there. While I am happy with my UI design, I am more confident in my ability to implement the logic that makes it all work together.
